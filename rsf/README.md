# RSF Tree Visualizer with AI-Powered Features

An interactive Streamlit application for visualizing Random Survival Forest (RSF) decision trees with integrated Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and AI-powered feature descriptions.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Tree Navigation**: Browse through individual trees in the RSF model using Next/Back buttons
- **Interactive Node Selection**: Click on nodes to trigger survival analysis
- **Hierarchical Tree Layout**: Root nodes at top, leaves at bottom with automatic zoom-to-fit

### Survival Analysis
- **Split Node Analysis**: Click blue split nodes to view Kaplan-Meier curves comparing patient groups based on feature thresholds
- **Leaf Node Analysis**: Click colored leaf nodes to compare survival outcomes between different leaf nodes
- **Statistical Testing**: Automatic log-rank tests with p-values and number-at-risk tables

### AI-Powered Feature Descriptions
- **Hover Intelligence**: Hover over blue split nodes for 1 second to get AI-generated feature descriptions
- **Clinical Context**: LLM provides contextual information about genomic features in NSCLC survival analysis
- **Cached Responses**: Feature descriptions are cached to improve performance and reduce API calls

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Run the installation script
./install_ai_features.sh

# Or manually install
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Edit the `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run rsf/see-forest-app.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Navigation
- Use **Next/Back** buttons to browse through different trees in the forest
- Current tree number is displayed (e.g., "Currently viewing tree 5 of 750")

### Node Interactions

#### Split Nodes (Blue)
- **Click**: Shows feature-based Kaplan-Meier plot comparing patients above/below the split threshold
- **Hover**: After 1 second, displays AI-generated description of the feature's clinical significance

#### Leaf Nodes (Colored)
- **Click**: Shows comparative Kaplan-Meier plot between the selected leaf and other leaves
- **Color**: Represents survival characteristics (red = poor prognosis, black = better prognosis)

#### Root Node (Green)
- **Click**: Shows feature-based KM plot if it's a split node
- **Hover**: Shows feature description if available

### AI Feature Descriptions
When you hover over a blue split node, the system:
1. Shows "üîç Looking up feature information..." while querying the LLM
2. Displays a clinical description covering:
   - What the feature represents (gene, pathway, clinical variable)
   - Known role in NSCLC prognosis/treatment
   - Impact on patient survival outcomes

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface with PyVis network visualization
- **Visualization**: vis-network library with hierarchical layout
- **Survival Analysis**: lifelines library for Kaplan-Meier estimation
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for feature descriptions
- **State Management**: URL parameters preserve tree and node selections across page reloads

### Data Flow
1. User hovers over split node ‚Üí JavaScript detects hover event
2. After 1-second delay ‚Üí Feature name extracted from node info
3. URL parameter set ‚Üí Streamlit receives feature request
4. LLM query ‚Üí Clinical description generated and cached
5. UI updates ‚Üí Description displayed in right panel

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Feature descriptions cached in session state
- **Debouncing**: 1-second hover delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when OpenAI unavailable
- **Auto-fit**: Automatic zoom-to-fit for optimal tree viewing

## Dependencies

### Core Requirements
- streamlit
- numpy
- pandas
- networkx
- pyvis
- matplotlib
- lifelines
- joblib

### AI Features (Optional)
- openai
- python-dotenv

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI Integration Issues
- **No API key**: Configure `.env` file with valid OpenAI API key
- **Rate limits**: Feature descriptions are cached to minimize API usage
- **Network errors**: App continues to work without AI features if OpenAI is unavailable

### Visualization Issues
- **Tree cutoff**: Increased height to 1000px and auto-fit functionality
- **Node selection**: URL parameters preserve state across page reloads
- **Hover timing**: 1-second delay ensures intentional hover actions

### Performance
- **Large models**: Application tested with 750-tree RSF models
- **Memory usage**: Session state caching optimizes repeated operations
- **Loading time**: Initial model loading may take a few seconds

## Example Use Cases

1. **Clinical Research**: Explore which genomic features drive treatment decisions in NSCLC patients
2. **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify key survival-associated features across different trees
3. **Model Interpretation**: Understand how RSF models make survival predictions
4. **Educational**: Learn about genomic features and their clinical significance through AI descriptions

## Future Enhancements

- Export functionality for survival plots
- Feature importance visualization
- Tree comparison tools
- Enhanced AI prompts for more specific clinical contexts
- Integration with additional survival models
