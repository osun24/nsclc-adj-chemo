  "GOLGA1": "GOLGA1 is a gene encoding a Golgi apparatus protein involved in vesicular trafficking and protein processing. In NSCLC, altered expression of GOLGA1 has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, potentially by promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Its dysregulation may serve as a biomarker for aggressive disease and influence patient survival outcomes by correlating with reduced overall survival.",
  "KIF3A": "KIF3A is a gene encoding a kinesin motor protein involved in intracellular transport and ciliary function. In NSCLC, altered expression or mutations in KIF3A have been associated with tumor progression and metastasis, potentially impacting cellular signaling pathways relevant to cancer growth. Its dysregulation may correlate with poorer survival outcomes, making it a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",
  "SLC8A1": "SLC8A1 is a gene encoding a sodium/calcium exchanger involved in cellular calcium homeostasis. In NSCLC, altered expression of SLC8A1 has been associated with tumor progression and may impact cell proliferation and apoptosis. Its dysregulation could influence patient survival by modulating tumor aggressiveness and response to therapy, making it a potential prognostic biomarker.",
  "INPP5A": "INPP5A is a gene encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, involved in phosphoinositide signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. In NSCLC, reduced INPP5A expression has been associated with tumor progression and poorer prognosis, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Consequently, lower INPP5A levels may correlate with decreased patient survival, highlighting its value as a prognostic biomarker and a possible therapeutic target.",
  "IFT140": "IFT140 is a gene involved in intraflagellar transport, critical for cilia function and cellular signaling pathways. In the context of NSCLC, aberrations in IFT140 expression or mutation may impact tumor cell signaling and microenvironment interactions, potentially influencing tumor progression. Although not yet a standard prognostic marker, altered IFT140 activity could be associated with differential survival outcomes by modulating pathways relevant to tumor growth and metastasis."
