In NSCLC, reduced CYB5A expression has been associated with poorer prognosis, potentially due to its role in modulating tumor metabolism and oxidative stress. Thus, CYB5A expression levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker influencing patient survival outcomes by reflecting tumor aggressiveness and treatment response.",
  "KLF9": "KLF9 is a gene encoding a transcription factor involved in regulating cell differentiation and oxidative stress responses. In NSCLC, reduced KLF9 expression has been associated with enhanced tumor progression and poorer prognosis, likely due to its role in suppressing cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Thus, KLF9 expression levels may serve as a prognostic biomarker influencing patient survival outcomes and guiding therapeutic strategies.",
  "LRPPRC": "LRPPRC is a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in RNA metabolism and energy homeostasis. In NSCLC, elevated LRPPRC expression has been associated with tumor progression and poorer prognosis, potentially due to its role in promoting cancer cell survival and metabolic adaptation. Thus, high LRPPRC levels may serve as a negative prognostic biomarker influencing reduced overall survival in NSCLC patients."
